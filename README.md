## JS Objects

Which may look like:

```javascript
var car = {
  name: "Fiat",
  start: function() {
    this.state = "On";
    console.log("And we're off!");
  }
  ...
}
```

### Definitions

A **property** is an association between a **key** and a **value**.

`name: "Fiat"`

`key: value`

A **method** is a **property** that is also a **function**.

```
  start: function() {
    this.state = "On";
    console.log("And we're off!");
  }
```
